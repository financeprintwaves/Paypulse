## Style Guidelines:

- Dark gradient background, transitioning from black to a deep grey.
- Deep Blue (#3F51B5), a balanced and serious hue that is desaturated and darkened enough to show up well on a dark scheme. It is a contemporary update of corporate color schemes of the past.
- A vivid reddish-orange (#FF5722). Chosen because this part of the spectrum creates the highest visual contrast with deep blue.
- 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and short amounts of body text, paired with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for longer body text.
- Red, blue, and yellow icons for visual interest and quick recognition.
- Modern layout with clearly defined sections for easy navigation.
- Subtle animations for a smooth user experience.
